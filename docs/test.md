## question

{:.tip}
If this toggle is on, the list includes all open PRs from repos where you have commit privileges, even if you're not a participant.  This is useful if you need to monitor repos for incoming PRs, such as if you're a manager, or an admin on an open source project.

## exclamation

!> Optionally, you can restrict this set of repos to only those repos connected to Reviewable, or that you watched or starred on GitHub. This can be useful if you have push permissions to a lot of repos and, for example, you donâ€™t want to see random open source repos while at work.
