This is the release log for Reviewable's Enterprise branch.  Each release has a two-part version number (_server.client_) with a corresponding tag on the Docker image.  Note that once you've deployed a given release you'll only be able to deploy releases with version components at least equal to its _min_ version number, which may constrain your rollbacks.

New releases are announced on the [reviewable-enterprise-announce mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reviewable-enterprise-announce).

#### Upcoming changes
- Upd: upgrade server environment to Node v6.
