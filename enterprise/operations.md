### Maintenance mode

You can switch Reviewable into maintenance mode to disable all clients' and servers' access to the Firebase datastore.  This can be useful when you need to atomically update the entire datastore, such as when restoring from backup or rotating encryption keys.

To turn on maintenance mode, run the following command:

```bash
$ curl https://$REVIEWABLE_FIREBASE.firebaseio.com/system/maintenance.json?auth=$REVIEWABLE_FIREBASE_AUTH \
       -X PUT -d '{"switch": true, "message": "An HTML message to your users."}'
```

The switch itself is public and will be publicly visible to anyone who cares to check.  You may also specify a private message that will be displayed in the browser's modal overlay only for users who are signed in.  The message is in HTML, so you can embed links to internal status pages and such.

The servers will log `Entering maintenance mode` and `Exiting maintenance mode` as appropriate; they don't need to be restarted.  Clients will show a modal overlay (sample below) and need to manually reload the page once maintenance mode is off.

To exit maintenance, run the following command:

```bash
$ curl https://$REVIEWABLE_FIREBASE.firebaseio.com/system/maintenance.json?auth=$REVIEWABLE_FIREBASE_AUTH \
       -X DELETE
```
