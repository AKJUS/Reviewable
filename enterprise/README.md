### Reviewable Enterprise

This directory contains documentation specific to Reviewable Enterprise, a version of the software that runs on your own premises.  Note that at the moment it doesn't yet support GitHub Enterprise (only github.com), and still requires an external connection to its Firebase datastore.

If you're interested in obtaining a license, or discussing the timeline for resolving the limitations above, please [get in touch!](mailto:support@reviewable.io?subject=Enterprise%20edition).

If you already have a license, you'll want to explore the links below.
