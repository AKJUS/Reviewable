### Reviewable Enterprise

This directory contains documentation specific to Reviewable Enterprise, a version of the software that runs on your own premises and can connect to your instance of GitHub Enterprise.  Note that it still requires an external connection to the Firebase datastore so it's not compatible with strict firewall and data locality policies, but it can optionally encrypt all sensitive data at rest with a key that never leaves your premises.

If you're interested in obtaining a license, please [get in touch!](mailto:support@reviewable.io?subject=Enterprise%20edition).
