<h3>1. Description of Service</h3>

<p>Reviewable is a code review service for GitHub pull requests.  Our Service provides improved diffs across all kinds of branch histories, batched comments, comment tracking across revisions until resolution, coordination of multi-party reviews, customization of the user interface and operation of the Service, and various other features.  Our Service is provided exclusively in a hosted form at the <a class="link" href="https://reviewable.io">https://reviewable.io</a> web site and connects directly with Your GitHub account and repositories.  A GitHub account is required to use Our Service and Our Service respects all the constraints and permissions applied to Your account and repositories in GitHub.</p>

<p>Please note that if You lose access to Your GitHub account for any reason, You will lose access to our data and information on Our Service as well.</p>

<h3>2. Registration</h3>

<p>Generally, as a condition of using the Service, You are required to create an account with GitHub.  Note however, that You may use Our Service in read-only mode for public data without creating a GitHub account or registering for Our Service.  After creating your GitHub account, You can register with Our Service by authorizing Us to access your GitHub account in your name, and You control the scope of the authority granted to Us. Initially, you only share your account number and public information associated with it. As you make use of more of Our Service, you will be asked to grant access to other information, such as your email address, repositories, etc.</p>

<p>To sign up for Our Service you must be at least thirteen (13) years of age.  Your login may only be used by one person&mdash;a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as you wish. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one account.</p>

<p>The registration information You provide must be accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of Your account. You may not use the name of another person or entity that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity without receiving appropriate authorization, or a name that is offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</p>

<h3>3. Price</h3>

<p>Certain Service plans are provided for a monthly subscription fee. If You elect to use paid Service plans, You agree to the pricing and payment terms in the plans specified on Our Site. We may add new services for additional fees, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in Our sole discretion. Any pricing changes or new payment terms shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to You as provided in these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>We accept credit cards and debit cards and will automatically charge Your payment account during the applicable subscription period. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or We are unable to process Your transaction using the payment information provided, We reserve the right to suspend or revoke access to Your account.</p>

<p>If You want to use a different payment method or if there is a change in Your payment account validity or expiration date, You may edit Your information by accessing Your account page. If Your payment account reaches its expiration date, Your continued use of the Service constitutes Your authorization for us to continue billing that payment account and You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. It is Your responsibility to keep Your contact information and payment information current and updated.</p>

<p>If You upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan, We will immediately bill you. For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis. When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, We will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account; however, refunds for annual plans will be made on a pro-rata basis. Unless You notify Us before the end of the applicable subscription period that You want to cancel, Your subscription will automatically renew for the period specified in Your plan and You authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee using any payment mechanism We have on record for You. Your subscription can be canceled at any time in Your account dashboard.</p>

<p>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and You shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</p>
